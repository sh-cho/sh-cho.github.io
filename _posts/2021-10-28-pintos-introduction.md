## Pintos에 대해

> Welcome to Pintos. Pintos is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system,
but it implements all of these in a very simple way. In the Pintos projects, you and your
project team will strengthen its support in all three of these areas. You will also add a
virtual memory implementation.
